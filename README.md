# ScratchCard

Simple app for hiring process.

The app is simple therefore I chose SwiftUI, MV architecture and omit any libs. If there would be a possibility for the app to grow in future I would implement FlowController pattern for in-app navigation (https://github.com/hugehoge/swiftui-flowcontroller-pattern) and I would most probably switch to MVVM as Model layer can grow a lot in MV. 

The Networking also contains Combine network provider yet it's not used.

If I'd have to work with UIKit, I would choose MVVM architecture and FlowController pattern.
